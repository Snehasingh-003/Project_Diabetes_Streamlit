# Project Title
Diabetes Risk Prediction Web App using Streamlit

# Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person is at risk of diabetes based on several health-related inputs such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more. The model is trained using supervised machine learning algorithms and deployed as a web app for user interaction.

# Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions globally. Early detection can prevent severe complications. This project builds a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data and allows users to test the prediction through a web interface.
